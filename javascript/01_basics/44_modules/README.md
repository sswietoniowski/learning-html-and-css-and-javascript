# Modules

Comparison between CommonJS and ES Modules can be found [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/commonjs-vs-es-modules-node-js/).

Generally, CommonJS is used in Node.js and ES Modules are used in the browser. However, Node.js can also use ES Modules starting from version 13.2.0. So, these days ES Modules are the preferred way to go.
