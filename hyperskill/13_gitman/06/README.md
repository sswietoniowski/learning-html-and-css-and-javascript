# Objectives

Switch to the `main` branch:

```bash
git switch main
```

Merge the develop branch to the `main`:

```bash
git merge develop
```

Create a new repository in your GitHub account and do not add any additional files like README.

Run the command `git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repository>` in your terminal, where `<your_username>` is your nickname in Github, and `<your_repository>` is the name of the repository you've created.

Now push your local repository to the remote with the command `git push -u origin main`. Tests won't check this part, but we strongly recommend you publish your repo to a public resource to practice it.
