# MultiMath

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to use TypeScript to create a library that can be used in a web page.

## Installing TypeScript and Configuring a Project

Information about how-to install TypeScript can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download).

To install it globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

To install it locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

Of course, we must install Node.js first. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To create a default configuration file, run the following command:

```bash
tsc --init
```

Complete list of all configuration options can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html).
