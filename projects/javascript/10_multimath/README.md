## Installing TypeScript and Configuring a Project

Information about how-to install TypeScript can be found [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download).

To install it globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

To install it locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

Of course, we must install Node.js first. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
