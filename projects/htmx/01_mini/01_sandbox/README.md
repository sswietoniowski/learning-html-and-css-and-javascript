# Sandbox

This is a simple demo of the basic features of the **[HTMX](https://htmx.org/)**.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C`.

To watch for changes in the files and automatically reload the server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default the server runs on port 3000.

You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

Or by setting the `PORT` environment variable in the `.env` file.

Open the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the demo.
